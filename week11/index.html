    <h1>Carbonated Drink Simulation</h1>
   
    <section>
      <h2>Intent</h2>
      <p>
        As a lover of anything fizzy, a system that I wanted to explore was <strong>carbonated
        drinks</strong> and their tendency to bubble under pressure, and potentially,
        <em>explode</em> if shaken too much. I must say that this is a deceptively simple
        everyday phenomenon, but once broken down, it reveals a whole network of
        interacting relationships: internal pressure, bubble formation, fluid
        dynamics, the strength of the bottle cap, and the cascading outcome that
        occurs once pressure exceeds a certain threshold.

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        I began by constructing a <strong>UML diagram</strong> and a
        <strong>flowchart</strong> to map out my thinking into applicable logic for code. This proved to be extremely useful for mapping
        out the system in its entirety before jumping into the deep end. These diagrams
        helped me determine the key objects needed for the simulation, their properties and behaviors, and how
        they would interact with one another.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <!-- Replace uml-diagram.png with your UML image filename -->
        <img src="images/uml.png" alt="UML diagram of the carbonated drink system" />
        <figcaption>UML Class Diagram: Bottle, Cap, Bubble, and WaterSplash relationships.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <!-- Replace flowchart.png with your flowchart image filename -->
        <img src="images/flowchart.png" alt="Flowchart of the carbonated bottle behaviour" />
        <figcaption>Flowchart: cause-and-effect logic of shaking, pressure, cap popping, and spill.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>In my system, there are four primary objects: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bottle</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Cap</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Bubbles</strong> within the liquid</li>
        <li><strong>WaterSplash</strong> that emerges when the cap bursts</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Because this concept was more complex than what we covered in class, I
        did use <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> to help structure and
        debug the code. Together, we iterated on each class so that the
        relationships between objects felt coherent, reactive and mirrored what I had mapped out in my diagrams.
      </p>
      <p>
        To simulate pressure and make it user-controlled, I made the bottle
        interactive: the user must <strong>click repeatedly and quickly</strong>
        to build pressure high enough for the cap to burst. I also added
        additional forms of indirect control: a <strong>dropdown</strong> to
        change the drink type (sparkling water, Coke, Fanta, lemonade), which alters
        the liquid’s color, and a <strong>tilt slider</strong> that rotates the
        bottle and affects the direction of the splash when the cap pops.
      </p>
      <p>
        An essential component for making this concept come to life was <strong>feedback</strong>.
        Users needed to understand how close they were to popping the cap, so I
        implemented a <strong>pressure bar</strong> that fills as they click. This provides clarity
        for the user in terms of actions they must take moving forward depending on if they want the cap to pop off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back, the entire process was highly iterative. As I continued working, new
        ideas emerged regarding how to make the simulation more dynamic,
        refined, and realistic. For example, at first the splash appeared when
        the cap popped, but the liquid inside the bottle remained constant.
        To make it resemble what we would see in real life, I implemented a <strong>liquid-level system</strong> so the fluid
        visibly drains as it sprays out. This is just one of many revisions that
        evolved the project from a simple prototype into a more realistic and
        expressive system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, this has been one of the most challenging projects I’ve
        completed in this class. At the same time, however, it has also been one of the most fun and creatively rewarding.
        I found that the complexity of the system I set out to create opened up a lot of room for experimentation,
        playfulness, and exploration. I’m very proud of how interactive,
        responsive, and engaging the final concept became!

      <h2>Interactive P5.js Sketch</h2>
      <p>
        The sketch below is the final interactive simulation built in P5.js. Click the bottle
        repeatedly to build pressure and attempt to pop the cap. Use the drink selector and tilt
        slider above the canvas in the embedded sketch to change the liquid type and splash
        direction.
