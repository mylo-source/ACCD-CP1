    <h1> Quote Reflections</h1>

    <h2>Programming Design Systems</h2>

    <h3>Quote 1</h3>
    <blockquote>
        "We now spend a majority of our time looking at screens instead of paper, 
        and this has created a great need for designers who understand how to design
        for digital devices."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I find this to be a broad generalization that overlooks significant global disparities. 
        I agree with the statement's premise concerning the high demand for digital design expertise
        but only in the context of socio-economically privileged areas. It's important to remember that 
        for many communities, particularly those with limited resources, screens are not the norm.
    </p>

    <h3>Quote 2</h3>
    <blockquote>
        "History has shown us that systems can cure the fear of the blank canvas, and it is a powerful concept to 
        encode these ideas into actual software."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Reading this through a designer’s eyes, what immediately comes to mind are design systems and the reusable UI components 
        they provide as reliable starting points. I find that they help me overcome the intimidation of a blank canvas (or screen, in this case). 
        However, I am also curious about the ways in which this phenomenon manifested before the digital age. How did thinkers and creators 
        in other fields encode structure and guidance to make beginnings less daunting? What areas of thought and action (art, architecture, science, etc.)
        did similiar systems emerge? What did they look like?
    </p>

    <h3>Quote 3</h3>
    <blockquote>
        "There is a need for educational material that teaches the fundamentals of graphic design in a modern way, especially if it also gives 
        students mental models for critiquing digital design projects."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I really appreciated that the author emphasized critique in relation to the value of his book. Critique is such a crucial part of any design process, 
        and emphasizing it reinforces how essential it is for developing thoughtful, intentional work. The fact that he weaves this into his initial discussion makes 
        me even more invested as a student in exploring his ideas and learning from the perspectives he presents.

    <h2>What do Prototypes Prototype?</h2>

    <h3>Quote 1</h3>
    <blockquote>
        "Is a brick a prototype? The answer depends on how it is used. If it is used to represent the weight
    and scale of some future artifact, then it certainly is: it prototypes the weight and scale of the artifact."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        This quote was particularly insightful to me, as it illustrates that virtually any object can serve as a prototype 
        when framed within the right context and purpose. Before reading this article, the concept of a prototype felt familiar 
        yet somewhat vague—I understand broadly but not the nuanced ways it can be defined. As I continue to build my own understanding, 
        this perspective on context and intention will definitely stay with me.
    </p>

    <h3>Quote 2</h3>
    <blockquote>
        "It is important to recognize that the degree of visual and behavioral refinement of a prototype does not necessarily correspond 
        to the solidity of the design, or to a particular stage in the process."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        This is an important idea I want to keep in mind. In many organizations, and even within my own design process, there is often an 
        implicit assumption that the more visually refined or behaviorally polished a prototype is, the closer it is to completion. This 
        quote challenges that notion and has encouraged me to reevaluate how I perceive prototypes, prompting me to consider their purpose 
        and effectiveness beyond mere aesthetics or interactivity. I wonder how many other designers hold this same implicit assumption? 
        Is it just me?
    </p>

    <h3>Quote 3</h3>
    <blockquote>
        "Be clear about what design questions are being explored with a given prototype—and what are not."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        This quote really resonated with me, particularly after having read the real-life example of the digital movie editor earlier
        in the paper. In this example, the project leader reflected on how the working prototype—intended to demonstrate functionality—was
        misunderstood by an audience that focused instead on its unfinished interface. This made me acutely aware of how important it is to 
        define and articulate the specific goals of a prototype to its audience (and knowing who that audinence is). 
        I find that the leader's idea of creating complementary prototypes to address different nodes of the model strikes me as a valuable strategy 
        for ensuring clarity and preparedness. From this particular quote and the example I refer to, I wonder how often misinterpretation in design 
        critique stems from mismatched expectations rather than the prototype itself.
