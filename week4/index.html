    <h1>Low-Poly Modeling in Blender: Christmas Living Room</h1>

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
            For this project, I wanted to create something that not only reflected the festive spirit of the upcoming holiday season but also connected to something a bit more personal. 
            My mother has always had a deep passion for home development and interior design, and growing up around her floorplans and furniture themeboards has made me very aware of how space can influence experience. 
            This naturally guided my thinking toward creating an interior scene. Combining that with the Christmas season felt like the perfect direction — something warm, joyful, and familiar. 
            Thus, the goal of this project became to design a cozy living room environment that captured that holiday essence in a simple, low-poly aesthetic.

    <section id = "ideation">
        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>My ideation process immediately began with my Ipad. Before even touching Blender, I made several rough drawings to figure out the layout and what sorts of key elements would define the space — 
            the sofa, the walls, the floor, etc. to suggest the living room-aspect; the plate of cookies, and the snowman to bring in the spririt of Christmas. These quick sketches helped me visualize proportions and 
            balance while also giving me an idea of where I wanted my camera to be placed. Regarding visual elements like furniture, I intentionally tried to find a balance between elements that would be easy enough to model as a beginner
             and others that would push me to learn new techniques. For example, while basic mesh shapes worked perfectly for the rug, cookies, and box structures, more rounded and organic objects like the bowl and the snowman allowed me to practice the low-poly style.
            Sketching and planning beforehand proved to be immensely helpful as it provided me with a clear visual goal and an organized workflow once I began modeling in Blender.

        <h2>Blender Design-Work</h2>
        <p>Once my sketches were ready, I started modeling in Blender. Before even trying to start my model, I began by rewatching our class tutorial to refresh my understanding of the low-poly process and the key shortcuts. I then positioned my lighting and camera. Next was building the foundantional structure
            and simple shapes first — the walls, floor, table and box structures. From there, I added smaller objects that brought the scene to life: the rug, a bowl, a plate of cookies, and the snowman. As I got more confident, I then experimented with more advanced modeling approaches. 
            The sofa in particular, with its cushions were particularly challenging, so I relied on YouTube tutorials to learn new techniques like edge-loop control. Another helpful trick I picked up from these tutorials (that I will be definitely using in the future) was splitting my viewport vertically: one side for 
            modeling and the other locked to my camera view. This allowed me to continuously monitor what the final render would look like while I worked. By the end, I'd like to think that I had a small but well-balanced composition that combined simple geometry with a cozy, holiday-inspired atmosphere.

    <section id = "approach">
        <h2>Approach to Learning Blender</h2>
        <p>Blender is completely new to me. My first interaction with this tool was actually last week through our class! However, I found it to be much more approachable than coding-based tools we have experimented with in the past (Visual Studio Code and with it HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). I someone who naturally gravitates toward visual and spatial learning, 
            so Blender felt rather intuitive and rewarding! My approach was very much self-guided: I would start by watching tutorials from both our class and online creators, then immediately practice what I learned by applying it to my own scene. When I struggled to understand something — for instance, a certain step, modifier or shortcut — 
            I paused and rewinded the tutorial, actually thought about it, tried again and if I succeeded, wrote it down. On that note, I kept a small notepad next to me where I wrote down functions or techniques that were difficult to remember. This simple habit helped me stay organized and learn through repetition. Over time, the workflow started 
            to feel like learning a new language — once I understood the “vocabulary” (tools and elements) and “grammar” (how they connect), everything became a lot more natural. This mindset made me more patient with mistakes and more open to experimenting, which in turn made the process a lot more enjoyable!

    <section id = "unfamiliar concepts">
        <h2>Working with Unfamiliar Concepts</h2>
        <p>During our class demo, certain ideas in Blender (like the low-poly extrusion method and manipulating geometry/vertices) felt intimidating. However, with this project, I was able to repeatedly break each concept down step-by-step, making it more intuitive over time. I started to view these unfamiliar concepts like small puzzles: I would try something, see how it behaved, 
            undo it, and try again until I understood what exactly was going on. Taking notes on shortcuts like E (extrude), S (scale), R (rotate), and G (grab) also helped reinforce this muscle memory. The more I practiced, the more I realized that making mistakes is actually a crucial part of learning a creative digital tool. Once I accepted that, working through the challenges 
            became much less frustrating and a lot more exploratory and fun!</p>

    <section id = "takeaways">
        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
        <p>This project taught me that low-poly modeling is an amazing way to get introduced to 3D form, proportion, and spatial design (making my mother proud!). Througout this project, I became more intentionally attuned to shape, lighting, and composition rather than deep detail. I also found it incredibly valuable to rely on both the class demo and targeted online tutorials. For me, this dramatically 
            improved both my skills and confidence in learning this new software. Perhaps the biggest takeaway for me was realizing that my learning style — visual, patient, creative, and curious — works best when I can experiment freely and use mistakes as part of the creative process. Overall, I have walked away from this project not only with a scene I am proud of, but also with a deeper appreciation for 
            how digital tools like Blender can blend technical learning with creative expression in ways that Figma just cannot!</p>
