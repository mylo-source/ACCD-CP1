        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>
            I wanted my composition to build off of what we explored during our in-class demo,
            but in a way that explores symmetry, color relationships, and visual rhythm more deeply. 
            This led me to design a generative composition using two primary shapes — the circle and the rectangle — 
            and to experiment with their variation potential in regards to color, size, and position as the viewer’s eye moves across the canvas.

        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <p>
            A problem I encountered early in the process — and one that significantly shaped my approach — was figuring out how to translate 
            the visual ideas I had in my head into code. As someone with limited experience in p5.js, this felt intimidating at first. I knew what I wanted
            visually: a layered, symmetrical, grid-like structure that still felt dynamic. But I wasn’t sure how to approach it logically in code.
        </p>

        <p>
            To solve this, I began by sketching my vision on paper. This wasn’t just about drawing the final image, but also breaking down its logic — what rules and patterns governed its structure? 
            I mapped out potential grid divisions, color relationships, and how I could use columns and rows as a route of logic. This “composition breakdown” became an incredible bridge between concept and code. 
            With this framework, I started building the composition digitally — mixing snippets from class demos with new logic that was informed both by my intial ideas and AI guidance.

        <p>
            The final composition builds a rhythm of symmetry and variation across the canvas, showcasing how simple rules — size, color, and position — can lead to complex behavior. 
            I hope that the contrast between the rectangles, circles, and the grids that hold them create a visual balance that feels 
            ordered, slightly chaotic, and organic.
        </p>

        <p>
            Along the way, I encountered several other challenges in bringing this rhythm to life. Initially, the grid only appeared in the first cell, which required revisiting how loops
            iterate through x and y coordinates to correctly tile the entire canvas. Another issue came from color logic: assigning different palettes for each column in HSB mode 
            required a lot of trial and error. Finally, integrating rectangles within each grid cell while scaling their sizes to match the circles’ growth took some time, but 
            leaning on the structure I had already established for the circles made the process much easier.

        <h2>The Biggest Problem & Solution</h2>
        <p>
            One of the biggest takeaways from this project was realizing that coding generative art isn’t about replicating a mental image — it’s about translating principles and rules into repeatable systems based on
            functional, procedural logic. It's all about starting small: one pattern and one rule at a time.
        </p>

        <p>
            If ever I am stuck moving forward, my starting point will always be sketching out the visual relationships. 
            In this case, once I visualized how each column could represent a “rule zone,” it became easier to code each behavior in steps. 
            From there, each addition— randomness, color choice, etc. — was built on this foundation.
